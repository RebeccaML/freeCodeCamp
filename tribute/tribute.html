          <p>Firefly is best described as an awesome, funny, dramatic space western television series. It was created by writer and director Joss Whedon.
            The series is set in the year 2517, when humans have reached a new star system and have just weathered a civil war.
            The story follows the adventures of the crew of Serenity, a "Firefly-class" spaceship.
            Some of the crew members fought on the losing side in the civil war, some were simply looking for a job and others were picked up by circumstance.
            Whedon pitched the show as "nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things."
          </p>
          <p>Firefly was cancelled after the first season because the Fox network sucks. In 2005, a follow-up movie called Serenity was released.
            Since then, the story has been continued through comic books and games.
            Firefly still has a loyal fan base who rightly claim that the series was cancelled far too soon.
