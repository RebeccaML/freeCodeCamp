                    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach
                        to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language
                        for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the
                        <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Website</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and
                        pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C).
                        Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a
                        Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example,
                        you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter.
                        Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash
                        character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code,
                        but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code
                        and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some examples:</p>
                    <code># this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
# ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."</code>

                <section id="using_python_as_a_calculator" class="main-section">
                    <header id="using_python_as_a_calculator"><h2>Using Python as a Calculator</h2></header>
                    <p>Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)
                    </p>
                    <h3>Numbers</h3>
                    <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value.
                        Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C);
                        parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:
                    </p>
                    <code>>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 50 - 5*6
20
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6</code>
                    <h3>Strings</h3>
                    <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes
                        ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result [2]. \ can be used to escape quotes:
                    </p>
                    <code>>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
'spam eggs'
>>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
"doesn't"
>>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
"doesn't"
>>> '"Yes," they said.'
'"Yes," they said.'
>>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
'"Yes," they said.'
>>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
'"Isn\'t," they said.'</code>

                    <p>Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together.
                        For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:
                    </p>
                    <code>>>> # Fibonacci series:
... # the sum of two elements defines the next
... a, b = 0, 1
>>> while a < 10:
...     print(a)
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
0
1
1
2
3
5
8</code>
                    <p>This example introduces several new features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first line contains a <em>multiple assignment</em>: the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> simultaneously
                            get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all
                            evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <span class="reserved-word">while</span> loop executes as long as the condition (here: <code>a < 10</code>) remains true.
                            In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value,
                            in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple
                            comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: <code><</code> (less than), <code>></code> (greater than),
                            <code>==</code> (equal to), <code><=</code> (less than or equal to), <code>>=</code> (greater than or equal to) and 
                            <code>!=</code> (not equal to).
                        </li>
                        <li>The <em>body</em> of the loop is <em>indented</em>: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt,
                            you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text
                            editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed
                            by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a
                            basic block must be indented by the same amount.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <span class="reserved-word">print()</span> function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. It differs from just writing
                            the expression you want to write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple arguments,
                            floating point quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format
                            things nicely, like this:
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <code>>>> i = 256*256
>>> print('The value of i is', i)
The value of i is 65536</code>

                    <p>Besides the <span class="reserved-word">while</span> statement just introduced, Python knows the usual control flow statements known from other languages, with some twists.
                    </p>
                    <h3><span class="reserved-word">if</span> Statements</h3>
                    <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the <span class="reserved-word">if</span> statement. For example:
                    </p>
                    <code>>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...
More</code>
                    <p>There can be zero or more <span class="reserved-word">elif</span> parts, and the <span class="reserved-word">else</span>
                        part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence
                        is a substitute for the <code>switch</code> or <code>case</code> statements found in other languages.</p>

                    <p>This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.

                    <h3>More on Lists</h3>
                    <p>The list data type has some more methods. Here are some of the methods of list objects:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>list.append(x) - Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to <code>a[len(a):] = [x]</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>list.extend(iterable) - Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to <code>a[len(a):] = iterable.</code></li>
                        <li>list.insert(i, x) - Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert,
                            so <code>a.insert(0, x)</code> inserts at the front of the list, and <code>a.insert(len(a), x)</code> is equivalent
                            to <code>a.append(x)</code>.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
