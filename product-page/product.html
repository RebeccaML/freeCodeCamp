            <h2 id="section2">Featured Item</h2>
            <p>Last seen at Minas Tirith, the fabled elven sword Glamdring has recently come into our possession.
                For this priceless artifact, we are asking only 4000 gold! We also came across some ancient footage of
                its discovery
                by its last known wielder: </p>
